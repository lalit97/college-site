			<h1>About Department</h1>
			<p>Instrumentation Engineering involves the applications of instruments for measurement and control. Design of instruments and their applications are two inherent aspects in InIstrumentation. Further, installation, commissioning and maintenance of Instrumentation systems are integral part of Instrumentation engineering. Automation being the primary objective today, the demand of Instrumentation Engineers is growing in industry. Instrumentation Engineers are the lead persons for Automation and Control.</p>

			<p>Instrumentation includes electronic, pneumatic, and hydraulic instrumentation systems as well. Computerized controls are used at a very large scale in process industries, refineries, petrochemical industries and many more. Biomedical Instrumentation is also an important subject in instrumentation. Because of this specific type of background an Instrumentation Engineer can choose his/her career in a wide range of engineering areas including IT industries.</p>

			<p>The Department came into existence in 2003-04 to offer undergraduate course in Electronic Instrumentation & Control Engineering. envisaging the upcoming trends in Automation of Industries. The Department has young, dynamic and motivated faculty and state of the art facilities. The faculty provides expertise in various fields of Electrical & Mechanical Measurement, Calibration, Control Systems, Electronics, Computers, Process Instrumentation, Bio-Medical Instrumentation, Microprocessors, Microcontrollers etc. areas. The Department has well equipped labs and various laboratories are under the development in the fields of Process Instrumentation, Analytical Instrumentation Laboratories with the recent trends of Technology such as PLCs and SCADA with Computer Control, Distributed Process Control and Field Bus technology.</p>
